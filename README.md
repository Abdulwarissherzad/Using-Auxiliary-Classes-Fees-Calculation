# UsingAuxiliaryClassesFeesCalculation
An Example, Using Auxiliary Classes  Problem for the Fees Calculation Application.
The 2-tiered architecture model can be established with Auxiliary Classes in OOP, Completely explained via this example. This is done by using a separate class (or classes) for the problem-solving code. We call these separate classes the “Auxiliary Classes”.

The task to be done through this project (Application) is:
At a certain University, the registry requires a small application to help those on the front desk work out the fees due.
The student need to provide their family name, whether they have been assessed as paying fees at the home rate or overseas rate and how many courses they will study in that year.
The application then gives them the total fees amount due. For the coming year the fees per course will be £600 for a home student and £2,000 per course for an overseas student. The record can be cleared ready to start again
